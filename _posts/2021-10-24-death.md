loving you is teaching me to be okay with death <br/>
because loving you is teaching me to be okay <br/>
with things that end. 

i'm scared that it's teaching me that i'm going to die too <br/>
scared it's making me want to die soon, <br/>
so you'll be there when it happens. 

because you won't be here, <br/>
not when i buy my first house or have my first child. <br/>
or when i stop breathing again, <br/>
or if i start loving again. 

i'm so scared of you not being there, <br/>
that things don't seen worth it anymore. <br/>
i don't want to feel happy anymore <br/>
cause happiness means i'm over you, <br/>
when i should be under you. 

loving you is teaching me not to love, <br/>
because loving you is the hardest thing i've ever done, <br/>
because loving you was the easiest thing i ever did, <br/>
because loving you is the last thing i'll ever do.
