i keep waking up in the middle of the night and running the tap without thinking about it. i'm never sure if i'm fully awake or somewhere between dreams, but i can always hear it echoing in the mornings: it's been running for months. 

if i stare hard enough i can see the water pooling behind your gaze; see, your shower's been clogged for a while now. every time i'm in there i keep toggling with the valve, but it's never enough to establish a real stream. jack bought drain cleaner last week; sometimes when i pass it on the counter i laugh at the irony of it all.  

i'm waiting for the bill to come, hoping to god that my meager salary can afford the cost of you in my life. because the washing machine in your building keeps eating my quarters. because i think the lady at my bank's getting tired of handing me rolls. because i've never been good with handling my reserve. because i don't know when i've done enough cashing out. 

tomorrow i'm going to ask my landlord to turn off the water in my building. i heard the flood season is coming again, and i'm gonna have to fix all of my piping. 

*** 

when i pour two cups of water i use my hands to scale which one is heavier; you always get the one with more. <br/> 
i've never been selfish with that i want, because what i want is for you to be happy. <br/> 
i've changed so much of myself to be okay with how i can have you, i hardly recognise who i am anymore. <br/> 
when i heard talk of unrequited love i thought it meant you'd never love me, not that i'd be a waterfall and you a stream. <br/>
your flow is just enough to edge me into a stronger current but never take me to the end. <br/>
my fingers ache from constantly making sure every part of you is satisfied. always scraping across your skin, always comforting in the silences between our breaths.
