what more can i give you when i’ve given you my keys — i’ve given you access to my building, within and without me. what more can i show you when you’ve seen me sleep, heard me speak my dreams. what more can i do for you when i’ve held you in my arms every night; i read somewhere that dogs sleep curled up to protect their most vulnerable parts from harm, that makes a lot of sense i think. 

if you were to break in i’d let you take anything, and everything. you don’t even have to ask. actually just take it all, please, i cant stand here going through what’s left behind and wonder if you would've wanted it. i cant stand thinking that there’s more left behind besides just me.

meanwhile, i’ll take you for what you are, little or lots, just not nothing, please not nothing.
