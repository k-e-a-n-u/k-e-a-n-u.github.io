a month ago we bought matching rain boots. they’re the kind with soles just about thick enough to step in a (smallish) puddle, but still need to avoid bigger trenches.

a month ago you decided we could try to work this out. and we walked out of fish cheeks with new weights on our steps. 

a month ago the blisters on me started to form, but i think they’re better now. every step is one i appreciate, because i feel wounds left from soles that hardly fit at all, now in someone else’s thrift store collection. 

so now, every morning we decide whether we want to keep wearing our new shoes, and every morning you wake up and whisper you love me. now, every morning i think: how could i not try again to break myself in?
