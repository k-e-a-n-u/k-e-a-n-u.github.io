i find myself analyzing my days more, picking through them piece by piece like i’m searching for a missing sock in my laundry basket. i want to find something to present to you, like a child with the stupidest item they found in the yard, trying to get you to notice me. 

what will you think of my newest pair of jeans? i bought them thinking of you, i’ll wash them twice before you return, fish them out for you again and again. they cover the parts of me that miss you most, holding me down when i feel like any minute i’ll fly away. 

i wonder if the previous owner is thinking of them, of how they used to hold them too. sometimes i’ll move from a pang of jealousy to a moment of grace, these jeans wouldn’t fit so well if they hadn’t broken them in, or if they hadn’t washed them countless times before. still it hurts to think of them belonging to someone else, right?

everything is temporary though, i doubt i’ll wear these pants to my grave, that would be wrong, right? but still i can’t picture me in anything else today… have you seen those shows where people wear something for so long their skin grows into it? i hate the parts where they have to cut themselves loose, god that looks like it hurts.
