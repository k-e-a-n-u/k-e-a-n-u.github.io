did you know that every time you leave, i sit and wait a few minutes in case you remember you forgot something? and that in those minutes i envy your essentials. i envy your keys most of all: why can't i come everywhere with you too? 

it's funny that i say that, because sometimes i feel inanimate too. but keys have worth, they have purpose in your life: keys break down doors, take you where you need to be. keys are not like me, who makes you build walls, makes your life worse. 

i wonder if keys would feel this way when you leave them behind. if they'd wait for your return for hours, or days, thinking about where you are, and why you don't need them.
