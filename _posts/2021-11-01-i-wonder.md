if you think about me as much as i do you, i wonder if that’s healthy. 

i wonder if you wonder how much i think of you also,  <br/>
or whether you know it’s always,  <br/>
or whether you don’t concern yourself with it.  <br/>

i wonder what you think about when you think of me, what my essence is that lives in you. for me your essence is… wonder.   <br/>
i wonder too much for my own good but wondering if it’s too much only adds to it. 

i wonder if i care too much, i wonder if it will kill me. i wonder if i keep wondering where i will end up, or who i will be <br/>
will i even be me anymore or just a collection of thoughts about,  <br/>
you.  <br/>
i wonder.
