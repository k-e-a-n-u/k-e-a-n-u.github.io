i find your sock in my laundry a few years from now. i’ve worn it so often i forgot it was yours mismatched with one of mine that looked similar. maybe somewhere in my day my subconscious thought of you enough for this moment to mean something, for me to notice this odd pairing. once so intimate yet now a forgotten memory between us, this simple piece of fabric that touched you only briefly before me, felt sacred - like i was allowed to feel you with me all day. back then we shared more than just socks, back then these metaphors seemed deeper to me.     

the rest of my day runs by, but when i get to bed at night i can’t stop thinking of you. this gateway sock is keeping me up. i wonder if you’re still with him, but can’t get myself to look you up, i don’t want to see how much you’ve changed. my mind keeps rolling back the film of our moments together, how we held each other those days when days felt endless yet end-full at the same time. 

shamelessly i’m sitting there going through my instagram archive; we hid it pretty well - found ways to downplay what we meant to each other. it definitely brought us thrill back then, leaving crumbs behind for no one in particular to see. i wonder if that’s why you left a single sock with me. this physical representation of your continued presence in my life, a reminder of what you used to tell me: that you’ll always be here. i think i resented you for it at some point, i found a note on my phone to buy bleach dated sometime after i thought i’d washed your old spice out of my t-shirts. 

i’m holding it in my hand the next morning; i was going to throw it out but i got distracted by my routine. do you remember how much i looked forward to my morning cup of coffee? i used to drink only half so i’d have some to bring back to bed and wake you up with. half of my life, i used to dream. 

i get home and the sock’s still on the counter, why is this stupid fucking piece of cloth taunting me like this. it hurts to think that it’s not even in a pair, fuck why am i empathizing with a sock? driven crazy by its existence, crazier even by the fantasy that you have the other one somewhere across the world, craziest by the thought that you’re holding it thinking about me too.

i’m going to put it in my basement, between the train engine clock i inherited from my grandmother and the box of journals with writing that never got anywhere; between my most meaningful pasts and my broken futures, where you belong. 

i’ll run the washing machine twice tonight, hoping to never find that second sock.
